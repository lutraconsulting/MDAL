UGRID -- NetCDF with Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata
================================================================================

.. shortname:: UGRID

.. built_in_by_default::

MDAL supports reading of unstructured grid (mesh) data from NetCDF files based on UGRID_ format. The UGRID conventions are an extension to CF_ conventions to describe hybrid 1D-2D-3D meshes and unstructured mesh topology and geometry.
UGRID is used for example by the `Delft3D Flexible Mesh Suite <https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/delft3d-flexible-mesh-suite/>`_, `FVCom/VisIt <http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Reading_NETCDF>`_, `ADCIRC <https://adcirc.org/>`_  and `BAW's unstructured grid tools <https://wiki.baw.de/en/index.php/NetCDF_unstructured_grid>`_. Additionally, MDAL supports detailed 1D network topologies and geometries.
