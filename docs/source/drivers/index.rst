    Note to contributors. The array-style presentation of drivers comes from
    driver_summary.rst, which is file generated by
    https://github.com/lutraconsulting/MDAL/blob/master/docs/source/build_driver_summary.py
    during the build. It is *not* stored in git.

    Developer comment: make html includes a hack to hide the table from
    the index.html file. We need to keep it visible so that the top-level
    index.html lists those pages.
