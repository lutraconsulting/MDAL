Please feel welcome to ask questions and participate in all of the
venues.  The `GitHub`_ communication channel is

GitHub
------

Visit http://github.com/lutraconsulting/MDAL to file issues you might be having with the
software. GitHub is also where you can obtain a current development version of the
software in the `git`_ revision control system. The MDAL project is eager to
take contributions in all forms, and we welcome those who are willing to roll
up their sleeves and start filing tickets, pushing code, generating builds, and
answering questions.
