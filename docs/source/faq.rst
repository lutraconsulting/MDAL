What does MDAL stand for?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

MDAL - Mesh Data Abstraction Library

When would I use it?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Most often this kind of representation is used when preparing data for simulation software or when viewing results of physical simulations, typically for meteorology, oceanography, hydrological or hydraulic models. All computation in such software is done on meshes, with values (physical quantities) usually stored in vertices (less commonly in edges or faces). Results usually comprise of various quantities (e.g. wind speed, water depth) which may be also time-varying (e.g. calculated water flow estimates in 5 minute intervals).

Some of the modelling software packages are free and open source (e.g. AnuGA, EPANET), there are some freeware packages (e.g. Basement, HEC-RAS) as well as many commercial pieces of software.

When was the MDAL project started?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In 2012, Peter Wells and Saber Razmjooei started QGIS Crayfish plugin.
