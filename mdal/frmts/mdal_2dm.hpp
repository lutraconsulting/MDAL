  /**
   * 2DM format specification used in TUFLOW, HYDRO_AS-2D and BASEMENET solvers
   * Text file format representing mesh vertices (ND) and faces (E**)
   * ND id x y z
   * The format supports lines, triangles and quads, where the elememts could be
   * stored with some intermediate points (e.g. triangle defined by 6 vertices, vertices
   * and the middle of the edges) We do support only simple definition, so E6T, E8Q and E9Q
   * are not supported.
   * E3T id 1 2 3 mat_id -> face type, id, vertex indices ..., material index
   *
   * full specification here: https://www.xmswiki.com/wiki/SMS:2D_Mesh_Files_*.2dm
   *
   * Exception for the official specification is for recognition of cell-centered
   * elevation values supported by BASEMENT 3.x releases
   * If face definition has extra column, it is parsed and recognized as
   * elevation, e.g. format for triangle
   * E3T id 1 2 3 mat_id elevation
   * and added automatically as "Bed Elevation (Face)"
   *
   * Note that some 2dm formats do have some extra columns after mat_id column with
   * data with unknown origin/name (e.g. tests/data/2dm/regular_grid.2dm)
   *
   * HYDRO_AS-2D also allows gaps in vertex indexing. In this case we support only files
   * where the vertices are sorted by ID in the source file (limitation of the implementation)
   *
   * Vertex/Face IDs should be indexed from 1. We support indexing from 0 for datasets in xmdf format,
   * but not for ascii dat format (since the loop is from 0 to maximumVertexId() which is in this case
   * numberical_limits<size_t>::max(); (limitation of the implementation)
