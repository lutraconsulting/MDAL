  /**
   * Loader of 3Di file format.
   *
   * The result 3Di NetCDF file is based on CF-conventions with some additions.
   * It is unstructured grid with data stored in NetCDF/HDF5 file format.
   * A division is made between  a 1D and 2D which can be distinguished through
   * the prefixes “MESH2D” and “MESH1D”. For both meshes the information is present
   * in coordinate, id, and type variables.
   *
   * A version of the data scheme is not present yet.
   *
   * The 2D Mesh consists of calculation Nodes that represents centers of Faces.
   * There is no concept of Vertices in the file. The vertices that forms a face
   * are specified by X,Y coordinates in the "Face Contours" arrays. The "lines"
   * represent the face's edges and are again specified by X,Y coordinate of the
   * line center. Data is specified on calculation nodes (i.e. dataset defined on faces)
   * and on lines (i.e. dataset defined on edges - not implemented yet)
   *
   * The 1D Mesh is present too, but not parsed yet.
